Conducted exploratory data analysis on a diabetes dataset using Python. Applied various machine learning classifiers, including Decision Trees, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to identify key predictors of diabetes. Utilized techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to address data imbalance, optimizing model performance to enhance recall and accuracy. This project focused on extracting actionable insights for early detection of diabetes.
